Classification of Skin cancer lesions on HAM10000 dataset.

A novel phase-filter based deep convolutional neural network for skin cancer lesion classification has been developed. The proposed method uses phase filtered images specific to each type of lesion as an input to the classifier to classify seven different type of skin cancer lesions.
